'''Task 2: Binary Search Tree
Create a binary search tree with the following functionality:
Insert_node
Insert a node into the tree
Search_for_node
Search for a specific node in the tree. Value to be searched by should be passed into the method.
Instantiate the binary search tree in the main.py file.
Add five nodes to the tree (make sure to go in both directions for testing).
Search for a node in the tree.
Make sure to consistently drop a breakpoint and step through both methods to ensure it is 
working properly.
